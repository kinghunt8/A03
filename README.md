GIT;
Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development 

GITHUB;
GitHub is a development platform inspired by the way you work. From open source to business, you can host and review code, manage projects, and build software.

Repository;
A repository is a central file storage location. It is used by version control systems to store multiple versions of files.

Clone;
Cloning refers to the making of an exact copy of an object, frequently under the paradigm of instance-based programming, or object-oriented programming.

Commit;
A commit is the making of a set of tentative changes permanent.

Push;
A push in client/server applications, to send data to a client without the client requesting it. IE, sending data rather then recieving.

Pull;
A pull in client/server applications, to recieve data to a client with the client requesting it. IE, recieivng data rather then sending.

Branch;
A branch is an instruction in a computer program that can cause a computer to begin executing a different instruction sequence and thus deviate from its default behavior of executing instructions in order.

Merge;
Merge is the process of combining the various versions of a file or folders.

Merge Conflict;
A merge conflict is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.

Fetch;
Fetch describes the process of a software program, script, or hardware device retrieving data and then moving it to an alternate location or displaying it.

Remote;
Remote desktop software enables the user to see and control a connected PC as though they are sitting directly in front of it. In this case program executable code.

Step 1;
create a github account


Step 2;
download Webstorm from jetbrains


Step 3;
Install Git to webstorm for the push and pull features.


Step 4;
Within github create a new repository for your code


Step 5;
Make sure to enable the readme file as you will make changes in their based on the code


Step 6;
Once git has been installed, coonect the file location correctly in webstorm as this is very important to call to it


Step 7;
Open VCS in the top bar of webstorm and allow for transfer


Step 8; 
Make code in webstorm!


Step 9;
Once you make changes in code be sure to commit these changes (To the repository you made, once you commit it will be saved, then a popup will occur, sigh in to your github account, and select push code


Step 10;
Once selected code push, your code will lock to your github account under the repository.


Step 11;
You have succeeded in uploading your code to the cloud of github! you may also pull code if you need it from your repository by repeating steps 9 and 10 by seelcting pull instead of push.


Step 12;
Be organized and make sure to commit after any changes are made!
